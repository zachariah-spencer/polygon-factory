Upgrading Objects:
	-Hovering the mouse over an object should bring up a tooltip with upgrade options.
	-If player has enough polygons they can purchase an upgrade which will adjust the multiplier and the speed of a generator.

Player Upgrades:
	-Player has the option to offer exponentially pricier lump sums of polygons to The Great Shape
	-When a milestone of these is reached, The Shape will take a new form(more pixels, maybe a shader, 
	more objects overlaid atop the primary circle)
	-Each new form and milestone will also upgrade the players movement speed and look

Player Cosmetics:
	-Player can offer further offerings to The Shape to receive random cosmetic items
	-Once an item is unlocked, the items can be swapped around in a cosmetics room at will

Hexagon Object:
	-Similar to triangles but with a slower generating pattern
	-Generates 20 polygons / 10 seconds
	-Costs 250

Custom Placement / Factory Editing:											-> Possibly Out of Scope <-
	-Ability to purchase objects from a menu instead of set spawn locations
	-Player can select an object from a list of unlocked objects in a sidebar menu
	-Player can place objects in any available location in any room
	-Once placed, the object's clickable tooltip menu will have a "sell" button,
	allowing the player to sell the object back at 100% value so they can re-place it
	in a new location if they please.
